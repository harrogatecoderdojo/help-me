# Harrogate Coder Dojo Help
Not sure what to do? Need a little nudge in the right direction?

You've come to the right place!

# Asking for help
1. You need to [create an account on github](https://github.com/join) (it's free!)
2. Go to our [Issues section](https://github.com/harrogatecoderdojo/help-me/issues)
3. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/harrogatecoderdojo/help-me/issues/new) that describes your problem.

We'll try to address your issues as soon as we see them but we're all volunteers and it might take some time to give you a good solution and/or explanation

## Describing your problem/question
Make sure to let us know:
* What technologies you are using (are you using **Scratch**? **Python**? Something else entirely?)
* What you are trying to do
* Any error that the computer gives you
* What you have tried so far
* A snippet of the problematic code
* A screenshot of the error/problem if helpful

If you are following a tutorial or a book it's a good idea to include that information as well.

## Examples
See the [this example issue](https://github.com/harrogatecoderdojo/help-me/issues/2)
